description: Using cloudflare pages with static pages generated by gatsby.

I heard about cloudflare pages on the podcast CodingBlocks dot net. The three hosts is a friendly bunch.
There is also a nice slack-community. I first generated a static site on Gatsby's cloud-service which I
deployed to cloudflare pages via GitHub. But the build failed due to the default node-version is lower than
the version gatsby expects. So I created a site on my Mac, pushed to GitHub and this also failed due to the
node-versioning, but this time with a different error message. When I searched for this error I saw a
StackOverflow-question where the answer was to add the expected node-version to the .nvmrc file like
`node --version > .nvmrc`. When I pushed this version it did deploy successfully.
